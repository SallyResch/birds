        Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates found on every continent, from icy
        Antarctica to tropical rainforests. They are defined by feathers, beaks
        without teeth, and lightweight skeletons that help many species fly.
        There are over 10,000 known bird species, ranging from tiny hummingbirds
        to large ostriches. Birds play vital roles in ecosystems by pollinating
        plants, spreading seeds, and controlling insect populations. They
        communicate through songs, calls, and visual displays, and many species
        migrate thousands of kilometers each year to find food and breeding
        grounds.
